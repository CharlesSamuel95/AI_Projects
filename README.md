# The Brave project focuse on using an AI technique called hebbian learning to get the program to learn not to be afarid of a monster that appears in the program 

# The museum project focuse on using the A* Pathfinding Algorithm to help the black figure in the program find the "art" piece inside the "museum" irrespective of his current location.

# More details for each project can be found in their Project_Info folder. The project report(in Brave project) gives a description on the components of the program and how to run the program. Project descriptionives in both projects) gives assignment overview and requirements.
